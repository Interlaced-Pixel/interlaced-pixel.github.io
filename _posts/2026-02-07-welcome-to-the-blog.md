Welcome to the new blog section of **Interlaced Pixel**! This blog is designed with a clean, Google-inspired aesthetic to ensure a great reading experience.

## Design Philosophy

The design uses the core Google colors:
*   <span class="g-blue">**Blue**</span> for primary actions and links.
*   <span class="g-red">**Red**</span> for alerts or emphasis.
*   <span class="g-yellow">**Yellow**</span> for highlights.
*   <span class="g-green">**Green**</span> for success states.

We use **Google Sans** and **Roboto** for typography, providing a modern and accessible feel.

### Code Example

Here is a snippet of Ruby code, just to show off the syntax highlighting:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
